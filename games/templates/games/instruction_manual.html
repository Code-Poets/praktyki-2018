    <p>
        This application was designed to provide support during your regular Munchkin game.
        The application provides an interface which displays current stats of all players in the game,
        such as level, bonus points, gender, class and race. The host of the game should sign in and create
        it's panel on the website. After the panel is created, an access code for it will be generated.
        The host should make this code available to other players. The players are then expected to use their mobile devices
        to create their nicknames and access the game with given code.
    </p>
    <p>
        And that's it! All you have to do for now on is remember to update your stats whenever they change during your game.
        Once any player achieves the winning level, a blockade will be set for other players and appropriate notification
        will be displayed on main game panel. The host can then decide to finish the game or alter it's rules,
        so the fun could go on. :)
